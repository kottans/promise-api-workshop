/*
 * Your task is to implement Promise static methods (.resolve, .reject, .all, .race, .allSettled, .any) via a Promise constructor.
 *
 * Note that after you implement a method, it's allowed to use it in other methods (e.g. `Promise.resolve`).
 *
 * Methods behavior should match the TC39 specification, so pay attention to the requirements described in the comments.
 *
 * Some inputs specify an "iterable", but for simplicity we'll be accounting for arrays only.
 *
 * Be sure to validate inputs â€” throw a TypeError if the input is invalid!
 *
 * After you're done, check your implementation by running
 * `npm run test`
 * in the console.
 *
 * If you'd like to run tests separately for individual methods, try:
 * `npm run test [nameOfTheMethod].js`
 *
 * For example, to run CustomPromise.resolve tests only:
 * `npm run test resolve.js`
